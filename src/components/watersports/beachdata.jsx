      "Radha Nagar Beach, located in Havelock Island, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, is considered to be one of the most beautiful and picturesque beaches in India. The beach is named after Radha, a character from Hindu mythology. The history of Radha Nagar Beach dates back to the early 20th century, when the British established a naval base on Havelock Island.

Following the war, the beach was largely untouched and remained a hidden gem until the 1990s, when the Indian government began promoting tourism in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. In 2004, Time magazine named Radha Nagar Beach as Asia's Best Beach, which brought it to the world's attention and made it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Today, Radha Nagar Beach is known for its crystal-clear waters, white sand, and lush green surroundings, and is a must-visit destination for travelers to Havelock Island.
